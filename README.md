# te-lib-demos

Demos for various libraries by me, @tommyettinger !

These libraries could include [digital](https://github.com/tommyettinger/digital),
[juniper](https://github.com/tommyettinger/juniper), [jdkgdxds](https://github.com/tommyettinger/jdkgdxds), [jdkgdxds_interop](https://github.com/tommyettinger/jdkgdxds_interop),
[textratypist](https://github.com/tommyettinger/textratypist), [cringe](https://github.com/tommyettinger/cringe), [gand](https://github.com/tommyettinger/gand), etc.

Demos tend to be built with [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/tommyettinger/gdx-liftoff) and are meant to test GWT (and potentially TeaVM) compatibility, which is hard to do in the
library repo itself.
